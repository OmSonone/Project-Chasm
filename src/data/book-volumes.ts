    content:
      'Once, there was a glorious kingdom established among the snowy peaks. In it lived the princess, the pale princess, whose beauty knew no equal. The magnificent sight of her snowy raiment adorned with stars left all who gazed upon her in awe.\n\nBut though she was the most beautiful of all, she was also the most lonely. The adoration of her subjects brought her no joy, and the splendor of her palace gave her no comfort.\n\nOne day, a group of hilichurls who called themselves "the Sunchased" invaded her kingdom. The princess dispatched her knights to drive off the monsters, but it was a trap. The invaders were merely a diversion. While the knights were fighting them off, the true attackers snuck into the princess\'s chamber.\n\nThese six strange, diminutive individuals called themselves "the Pygmies." They claimed to hail from a distant land where the sun shone brightly and brought with them a box that, they claimed, contained that very light.',

      'The princess was curious about the box that the Pygmies had brought with them. "What is inside this box?" she asked.\n\n"Inside is warmth, light, and life itself," replied the Pygmies. "It is a gift from our homeland to yours. But be warned — you must never open it when the night has fallen, for the light of the sun will chase away the moonlight, and the moon shall fall from the sky."\n\nThe princess did not believe them, for she had never seen the sun before. In her kingdom, it was always night, and the moon had always hung in the sky.\n\n"Very well," said the princess. "I shall open this box when the sun rises tomorrow."\n\nBut in her kingdom, the sun never rose. So that night, overcome with curiosity, the princess opened the box. A blinding light burst forth, filling her chamber with warmth she had never known. The moonlight began to fade, and true to the Pygmies\' warning, the moon trembled in the sky.\n\nPanicked, the princess quickly closed the box, but it was too late. The damage was done. The moon had already begun its descent.',

    volume: 'Volume 1',
    content:
      '"The world is a vast and empty place."\n\nVera sat on the edge of the cliff, her legs dangling over the precipice. The wind tousled her hair as she gazed out at the setting sun. The sky was ablaze with orange and pink, but the beauty was lost on her.\n\n"What\'s the point of it all?" she wondered aloud. "We live, we die, and in between, we suffer."\n\nShe had lost everything — her home, her family, her purpose. All that remained was a hollow ache in her chest and the constant companion of melancholy that followed her like a shadow.\n\nAs the last rays of sunlight disappeared beyond the horizon, Vera stood up. She had made her decision. If life had no meaning, then perhaps death would provide the answers she sought.',

      'But as Vera stood at the edge, ready to step into the void, a voice called out to her.\n\n"I wouldn\'t do that if I were you."\n\nShe turned to see a young man standing a few paces away. He was leaning against a tree, arms crossed, with an expression that was neither concerned nor indifferent.\n\n"And why not?" Vera asked, irritated by the interruption.\n\n"Because," he said, pushing himself away from the tree and walking toward her, "you haven\'t seen the sunrise yet."\n\nVera scoffed. "I\'ve seen plenty of sunrises."\n\n"Not like the one tomorrow," he replied with a mysterious smile. "Tomorrow\'s sunrise will change everything."',
